The aim of this bachelor thesis was to provide an overview over the topic Real-Time-Communication in the web. This thesis is directed at students and developers in the IT-Business, thus the basics of data transfer in the internet are only explained shortly. Current state of the art technologies like Polling, Long-Polling, Server-Sent-Events and Web-Sockets will be explained and compared to each other. The focus of this thesis is WebRTC, thereby the background and development of the WebRTC standard will get explained.  Additionally, the differences in architectures compared to classical systems get highlighted. After the theoretical basics have been explained the focus shifts to problems that will occur in a real life setting, whereby the goal is to explain the problems and offer solutions to fix them. Another focus lies on the connection establishment, whereby the process of establishing an WebRTC-connection is called signaling. Because signaling is not standardized the most common practices and techniques get explained. Especially the topic of Hole-Punching, the process which is used to find a path between the two participants will be described. With the learned concepts a prototype will be presented. Overall there will only be a short oversight over the application of WebRTC, whereby some points as the Session-Description-Protocol-Objects will be explained in detail. It will be analyzed for what scenarios WebRTC is suited or not suited.
