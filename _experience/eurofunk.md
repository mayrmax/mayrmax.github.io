I work as part of the [eOCS][eocs] project in eurofunk, the project offers a **digital command center solution** for blue light organizations.
The frontend is developed in **Angular** backed up by a Spring backend. I'm responsible for the realization of features
concerning technical aspects as well as **user experience**, fixing bugs, and guarding **code quality** in the merge review process.
One of my favorite tasks is the creating of custom form controls and reusable components in general.
Apart from that, I worked on keeping the **software architecture** sustainable by modularizing it and enforcing boundaries between those modules.
From time to time I'm on-site and analyzing bugs and system performance, one of my main focuses is the **rendering performance** in the browser.
