I work as frontend lead for the the [DataSpace Kit][dsk], the DSK offers a data sharing solutions for trusted data sharing between various participants. My focus lies on our digital twin solution, our solution allows users to define a custom vocabulary and create a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph can than be manipulated, queried and maintained via various API's and applications. I develop concepts about how we can advance our stack, develop and maintain new applications and features and contribute at various working groups such as the Self-Description working group of [GAIA-X][gaiax].
