I started my higher education in Saalfelden originally in the area of **electrical engineering**.
User applications only played a side role in my chosen program but through the offered lecture,
I quickly discovered my **love for programming**. As my final project,
I choose to do a software project that enables users to [create digital notes][mynoteboard].
