I picked this master study program due to the possibility to **focus on projects**.
I could pick an area that I found interesting and create a project learning a ton of new stuff in the process.
This opportunity allowed me to **explore technologies** that are brand-new and plan the **software architecture** around it.
The most noteworthy projects that I created during the time was a project to create a [microservice architecture][documentmanagement],
a project that realizes [collaborative note-taking][collaborativenotes] and my master thesis that explores [personal data stores][selfbox].
