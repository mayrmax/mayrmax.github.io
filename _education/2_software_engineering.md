In this bachelor study program, I learned the theory and practice of **software engineering**.
I started with the basics and moved on to specialize in **web engineering**.
What I liked most about the study program was the **broad range of topics** covered where one could find out what interests him most.
One of my bigger web projects that I did for my studies was a [biodiversity][biodiversity] project for the national parkâ€™s association Austria.
