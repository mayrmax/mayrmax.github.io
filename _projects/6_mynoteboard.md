This project realized a note-taking application for *Windows 8 (RT)* that utilized the GPU to render strokes on a virtual piece of paper.
For the rendering part a *DirectX* wrapper called [SharpDX][sharpdx] was used in combination with *C#*. The application allowed the user to pair their
device with others via *Bluetooth*, *Wi-Fi* or over the network to work together on one piece of paper.
