This project explores the concept of **reverse geolocation** and *WebRTC* as part of my theoretical bachelor thesis to
create chat rooms based on a user's location. Once the correct room for a user has been found, or a new one gets created
the user starts a new *WebRTC* session. This way no data traffic is routed via a third party, saving server costs
and maintaining the privacy of the users.
